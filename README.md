This repository is a comprehensive collection of pre-trained models and source code for various CCTV surveillance and analysis tasks. Whether you're working on security, retail analytics, or general monitoring, you'll find a range of useful tools here.

## About This Repository
This project provides a curated set of computer vision models designed specifically for analyzing CCTV footage. Each model comes with the necessary code to get you started on tasks ranging from basic object detection to complex anomaly and behavior analysis. The primary goal is to offer a modular and accessible toolkit for developers and researchers in the field. üßë‚Äçüíª

## Available Models
üëÅÔ∏è Core Detection & Recognition
- Face Detection: Locating human faces in video streams.
- Face Recognition: Identifying specific individuals from a database.
- Object Detection (People): Detecting and tracking individuals.
- Object Detection (Vehicles): Detecting and tracking cars, trucks, motorcycles, etc.
- Object Detection (Security Threats): Identifying potential security threats like weapons.
- Multi-Stream Detection: Processing and analyzing video from multiple camera feeds simultaneously.
- Motion Detection: Detecting any motion in a scene.

‚ö†Ô∏è Anomaly & Activity Detection
- Intrusion Detection: Alerting when an object or person enters a restricted area.
- Trespassing Detection: A specialized model for identifying unauthorized entry onto a property.
- Activity Detection: Recognizing specific human actions or activities.
- Running Detection: Identifying individuals who are running.
- Loitering Detection: Flagging individuals who remain in an area for an unusual amount of time.
- Fighting Detection: Detecting physical altercations between people.
- Crowd Anomaly: Identifying unusual patterns or behaviors in a crowd.
- General Video Anomaly: A general-purpose model for detecting any unusual event in a video feed.

üìà Analytics & Counting
- People Counting: Counting the number of people passing through a designated area.
- Object Counting: A general model for counting specific objects.

üõçÔ∏è Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Applications
- Customer Emotion Recognition: Analyzing facial expressions to gauge customer emotions (e.g., happy, neutral, upset).
- Product Interaction: Recognizing how customers interact with products on a shelf.
- Assistance Gesture Alert: Detecting gestures (like a raised hand) to signal a need for assistance.
- VIP/Blacklisted Recognition: Identifying known individuals (e.g., VIP customers or blacklisted persons) upon entry.
